      Hi, my name is Jakub, I'm 17 years old and I'm from the Czech Republic. My
      first encounter with programming was in 2019. It was a year when I was
      very dedicated to creating Minecraft servers. My first programming
      language was JavaScript when I started making discord bots in it. After a
      few months I also got into Java in which I made plugins for Minecraft.
      Then I tried web development and that's what I liked the most. So I
      started with HTML and CSS, then I added JavaScript and after another year
      I started working with the VUEJS framework. Currently I'm also trying
      mobile app development using FLUTTER and .dart. I have pretty big goals
      when it comes to programming and would like to start working as a WEB
      DEVELOPER in 2022 and be able to travel the world and work at the same
      time.
