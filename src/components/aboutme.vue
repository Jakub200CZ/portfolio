      Hi, my name is Jakub, I am 18 years old, I come from the Czech Republic
      and I enjoy creating websites. My first encounter with any code was in
      early 2019 and it was JavaScript, then I spent a year creating discord
      robots. At the end of 2019, covid and quarantine came and that was the
      point where I started creating websites where I also stayed. I started
      like everyone else with HTML and CSS, and then came the slow addition of
      JavaScript. I'm currently making pages using a Front-End Framework called
      Vue. since 2019, I have learned to make great use of GOOGLE and have
      learned to deal with cold head problems. It moved me a lot and I'm glad I
      got to it.
